The goal of this project is to develop a simple application of deposit and Withdrawal that respect 3 rules:

- the user can add some money to his account.
- the user can get some money from his account.
- the user can check the amount of money on his account.

		starting hypothesis:

- the user is already connected.
- the interface is the console.
- their are no minimum of money for the account.


for this project, I develop using TDD.
 i use The MVC model, and i start with the model because both Controller and view need it and because it is independent.
 
 first I create the Test class.
 
 
Now i have the class and i've tried to create an object Account but it does not exist.

So I create the model.Now i had text and I see that their are missing things in the Model.
I add methods and variable to the model.

The test fail so i correct the model
